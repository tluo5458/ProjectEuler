# ProjectEuler
ProjectEuler Code Solutions.

Currently completed problems are 1-145, 149, 151, 157, 162, 164, 173-174, 179, 183, 187-188, 190-191, 206, 243, 719, 727, and 743. Any files that aren't in here were done by hand or otherwise not in code.

A lot of the earlier files (particularly problems 1-50) are very messily written: it took a while for me to really start caring about how these were formatted since I wasn't intending on making these public. Also some of them are very inefficient. I generally try to follow a 3-second rule, but this has only really applied to more recent files (problems 100+), and even then there are definitely exceptions.

If you have any questions/comments about the files here, shoot me an email at tluo5458@gmail.com or a Discord DM at tluo5458#4210. No guarantees that I'll respond, but I've been trying to maintain better coding practices.
